# Velocity's Arcade

Velocity's Arcade is my attempt at making a game service for FLOSS games, where players can download games for free, or play web games in the browser.

## Types of Games

Velocity's Arcade games are split into three types - Desktop, Web and GZDoom.

*   Desktop games are available for Windows and Linux platforms and are made using the Godot engine.
*   Web games are available for modern web browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari) and are made in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
*   GZDoom games are DOOM mods, available for any platform GZDoom can run on and are made using SLADE for the GZDoom source port. These require DOOM2.WAD to run.

Two other types are planned but not yet considered - Mobile and Terminal.

*   Mobile games are available for the Android platform, and like Desktop games, they are made using the Godot engine.
*   Terminal games are command-line games available for Windows and Linux platforms and are written in Rust.

Desktop and Terminal games could be brought up on macOS, although the Mac platform is not officially supported by Velocity's Arcade. You'll have to build it for macOS yourself.
